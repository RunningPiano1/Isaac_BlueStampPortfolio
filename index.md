# Isaac's Project
Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails!

You should comment out all portions of your portfolio that you have not completed yet, as well as any instructions:

For your second milestone, explain what you've worked on since your previous milestone. You can highlight:
- Technical details of what you've accomplished and how they contribute to the final goal
- What has been surprising about the project so far
- Previous challenges you faced that you overcame
- What needs to be completed before your final milestone

Milestone 1 was all about getting my compartments laid out and ready to be used. There are two notable components in terms of size and appearance. The first is the Adafruit MLX90640 infrared camera sensor---this is the module that makes thermal imaging possible. Its purpose is to detect temperature variations across an image. The second is the Raspberry Pi 4. It is a small yet powerful computer that is able to create an interface with the MLX90640 sensor. Its connectivity options along with SSH server support will allow me to display the camera image on my monitor using my laptop.
The SD card also plays a vital role. Inside it holds the entire Raspberry Pi OS. This acts as the Pi's storage device and is responsible for keeping all of the libraries. project files, and configuration settings that I will be using throughout the next few weeks. Some essential libraries I have installed are CircuitPython and Blinka. CircuitPython is the main language Iâ€™ll use to write scripts for the sensor, and Blinka acts as a compatibility layer that allows CircuitPython to run on the Raspberry Pi while giving access to standard communication protocols like GPIO, I2C, and SPI.

So far, I have successfully assembled the hardware components and installed the entire OS operating system on my SD card. After that, I configured the necessary libraries including CircuitPython and Blinka to make programming possible. Lastly, I started basic integration and circuitry between my camera sensor and Raspberry Pi.

The main challenge I faced was getting all of the modules, packages, and libraries installed and updated to their newest versions. I frequently ran into issues where the SD cards would be corrupted or improperly formatted, which prevented the Raspberry Pi from powering on or being detected by my laptop, either on my file manager or Raspberry Pi Imager. Fixing these problems often meant restarting the entire installation, putting a true test to my patience.

Next up, my immediate goal is to get the circuitry working. Doing this will allow me to display the thermal image on my monitor. While that is being done, I also need investigate the "Electronics Fun Kit". There are still many different wiring components inside I have never had hands-on experience with until now, such as the breadboard, jumper wires, resistors, LEDs, and more. Learning about the functions and compatibilities of these numerous pieces could help me decide what kind of modifications I would like to add. One feature I am planning to implement is a temperature readout mode. With this feature, the temperature can be displayed next to the cursor in real time, based on its location on the thermal image.

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
