# Isaac's Project
Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails!

You should comment out all portions of your portfolio that you have not completed yet, as well as any instructions:

For your second milestone, explain what you've worked on since your previous milestone. You can highlight:
- Technical details of what you've accomplished and how they contribute to the final goal
- What has been surprising about the project so far
- Previous challenges you faced that you overcame
- What needs to be completed before your final milestone 

# First Milestone

Milestone 1 was all about getting my compartments laid out and ready to be used. There are two notable components in terms of size and appearance. The first is the Adafruit MLX90640 infrared camera sensor---this is the module that makes thermal imaging possible. Its purpose is to detect temperature variations across an image. The second is the Raspberry Pi 4. It is a small yet powerful computer that is able to create an interface with the MLX90640 sensor. Its connectivity options along with SSH server support will allow me to display the camera image on my monitor using my laptop.
The SD card also plays a vital role. Inside it holds the entire Raspberry Pi OS. This acts as the Pi's storage device and is responsible for keeping all of the libraries. project files, and configuration settings that I will be using throughout the next few weeks. Some essential libraries I have installed are CircuitPython and Blinka. CircuitPython is the main language Iâ€™ll use to write scripts for the sensor, and Blinka acts as a compatibility layer that allows CircuitPython to run on the Raspberry Pi while giving access to standard communication protocols like GPIO, I2C, and SPI.

The main challenge I faced is getting all of the modules, packages, and libraries instaleld and updated to their newest version. In numerous occassions, something would go wrong regarding data transfer, file organizer, installations, and image display. Most of those issues stemmed from the SD card setup. The SD card I was given seemed to have formatting issues and/or was corrupted because it would not show on either my file manager or Raspberry Pi Imager. In my opinion, the most frustrating aspect was the time it took to undo everything whenever there was an issue. 

Next up, my first priority is to get the circuitry working. Doing this will finally allow me to display the thermal image on my monitor. While that is being done, I also need investigate the "Electronics Fun Kit". There are still many different parts inside I have never seen in my life, such as the breadboard, jumper wires, resistors, LEDs, and more. Learning about the functions and compatibilities of these numerous pieces will make the wiring and circuitry much more intuitive to me. I have already come up with one modification I would like to add---I intend to develop a temperature readout mode so that the temperature can be displayed next to the cursor relative to its location on the thermal image.

For your first milestone, describe what your project is and how you plan to build it. You can include:
- An explanation about the different components of your project and how they will all integrate together
- Technical progress you've made so far
- Challenges you're facing and solving in your future milestones
- What your plan is to complete your project

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
